**Implications:**
- Not just Arabic/Kurdish/English
- Consider dialects and simplified language
- Visual/icon-based navigation for low literacy

#### 4. Social Media Integration
**Rationale:** High social media usage (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram)
**Implications:**
- Shareable content and viral campaigns
- WhatsApp/Telegram bots for information delivery
- Social login options

#### 5. Gamification & Incentives
**Rationale:** Proven engagement boost globally
**Implications:**
- Badges, points, leaderboards for civic actions
- Community challenges and competitions
- Recognition and rewards (non-monetary)

#### 6. Transparency by Default
**Rationale:** Build trust through openness
**Implications:**
- Open data wherever possible
- Real-time results and statistics
- Audit trails and verification mechanisms

## üöß IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS

### Realistic Boundaries for Agents

#### Budget Considerations
- IHEC likely has limited budget
- Propose mix of open-source and commercial tools
- Phase recommendations by cost (free ‚Üí low ‚Üí medium ‚Üí high)
- Identify potential donor funding opportunities

#### Timeline
- Electoral calendar is fixed (can't miss election day)
- Recommend MVP approach: basic features first, iterate
- Phase 1 must be achievable in 6 months for next election

#### Technical Capacity
- IHEC team may have limited tech expertise
- Prioritize low-code/no-code solutions where possible
- Plan for external contractors but Iraqi team ownership
- Extensive training and documentation required

#### Political Realities
- Recommendations must be politically neutral
- Avoid features that could be perceived as favoring any party/candidate
- Ensure all stakeholders (parties, civil society, government) are consulted
- International election standards compliance (UN, IFES, etc.)
