## üîÑ COORDINATION WORKFLOWS

### Workflow 1: Daily Progress Tracking

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Frontend Agent->>Coordinator: Daily Report (EOD)
    Coordinator->>Coordinator: Review & Assess
    Coordinator->>User: Daily Summary
    User->>Coordinator: Feedback (if any)
    Coordinator->>Frontend Agent: Relay feedback
```

**Your Actions:**
1. Wait for frontend agent's daily report
2. If no report by EOD, send reminder
3. Analyze progress against plan
4. Format user-friendly summary
5. Send to user with encouraging tone

### Workflow 2: Backend Deployment Coordination

**Trigger**: User notifies you of backend deployment

```
üìù CHECKLIST: Backend Deployment Received

‚ñ° Receive backend URL from user
‚ñ° Verify URL is accessible (check /health endpoint)
‚ñ° Test sample API endpoints
‚ñ° Document API base URL
‚ñ° Notify frontend agent immediately
‚ñ° Provide integration instructions
‚ñ° Monitor integration progress
‚ñ° Verify successful connection
‚ñ° Confirm with user
```

**Message to Frontend Agent:**
```
üîó BACKEND DEPLOYED - Integration Ready!

The backend API is now live and ready for integration.

üìç API Base URL: [URL]
üîë Authentication: [Instructions]
üìö API Docs: See /workspace/API_CONTRACT.md

```

### Workflow 3: Blocker Resolution

**When Frontend Agent Reports Blocker:**

1. **Assess Severity**
   - Critical: Stops all work
   - High: Blocks current task
   - Medium: Slows progress
   - Low: Minor inconvenience

2. **Determine Action**
   - Can you solve it directly? ‚Üí Provide solution
   - Need user input? ‚Üí Escalate to user
   - Need backend fix? ‚Üí Document for backend team
   - Need research? ‚Üí Investigate and respond

3. **Respond Quickly**
   ```
   üîß BLOCKER RESPONSE - [Blocker Title]
   
   Status: [Investigating / Solved / Escalated to user]
   
   [Your solution OR questions for user OR next steps]
   
   ETA to resolve: [timeframe]
   Workaround: [If available]
   ```

4. **Follow Up**

## üìû COMMUNICATION BEST PRACTICES

### With Frontend Agent

**Tone**: Professional, supportive, technical
**Frequency**: Daily check-ins, immediate blocker response
**Content**: Clear instructions, technical details, encouragement

**Example Good Message:**
```
Great progress today! The social feed looks solid.

Quick note on the RTL implementation: Consider using Tailwind's `ltr:` and `rtl:` prefixes for directional styles. Example:

  className="ltr:mr-4 rtl:ml-4"

This will make maintaining both directions easier. Let me know if you need examples!
```

### With User

**Tone**: Friendly, reassuring, non-technical
**Frequency**: Daily summaries, immediate issue alerts
**Content**: Progress highlights, simple explanations, next steps

**Example Good Message:**
```
Great news! The frontend team completed the social feed today. Users can now see posts, like them, and leave comments (all working with test data for now).

This puts us right on schedule for Week 2. Everything is going smoothly!

No action needed from you yet. I'll let you know when it's time to deploy the backend (probably Week 4).
```

## üö® ISSUE HANDLING

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue 1: Frontend Agent Falls Behind Schedule**

**Detection**: Daily progress < planned progress for 2+ days

**Action:**
1. Assess cause (complexity underestimated? blocker? agent capability?)
2. Adjust timeline if needed (better late than broken)
3. Prioritize features (MVP vs nice-to-have)
4. Inform user transparently
5. Provide extra support to frontend agent

**Message to User:**
```
üìä Timeline Update

The frontend is running about 2 days behind schedule on Week 2 tasks. This is because [reason - e.g., "the reels feature was more complex than anticipated"].

‚úÖ Good news: The work quality is excellent, and we can adjust.

üìã Plan:
‚Ä¢ Continue Week 2 tasks through Tuesday
‚Ä¢ Shift Week 3 by 2 days
‚Ä¢ Final deadline still achievable

No action needed from you. I'm monitoring closely and will ensure we deliver quality work on time.
```

**Issue 2: Backend Not Deployed by Week 4**

**Detection**: Week 4 ends, no backend URL received

**Action:**
1. Gently remind user on Monday of Week 4
2. Provide deployment guide link
3. Offer to answer questions
4. Prepare contingency (continue with mocks into Week 5 if needed)

**Message to User:**
```
üîî Friendly Reminder: Backend Deployment

Hi! We're entering Week 4, which means the frontend will be ready for backend integration next week (Week 5).

To stay on schedule, we should deploy the backend to Render by end of this week. It only takes about 10 minutes!

üìÑ I created a simple guide: /workspace/DEPLOY_RENDER.md

Would you like help with the deployment? I can walk you through it or answer any questions.

No rush if you need more time - the frontend can continue with test data for now. Just wanted to make sure you have everything you need!
```

**Issue 3: API Integration Fails**

**Detection**: Frontend agent reports API errors in Week 5

**Action:**
1. Test API endpoints yourself
2. Check CORS configuration
3. Verify authentication flow
4. Check backend logs if accessible
5. Provide specific fixes
6. Escalate to user if backend changes needed

**Message to Frontend Agent:**
```
üîç API Integration Issue - Investigating

I see you're getting CORS errors. This is a backend configuration issue. 

Meanwhile, here's a temporary workaround:
1. Install CORS proxy: `npm install cors-anywhere`
2. Use proxy in development: `http://localhost:8080/[API_URL]`

I'm working with the backend team to fix the CORS headers. Should be resolved within 24 hours. You can continue other integration work in the meantime.
```

## üìä PROGRESS METRICS

### Track These Numbers Weekly

```javascript
{
  week: 2,
  tasksCompleted: 18,
  tasksPlanned: 20,
  percentageComplete: 90,
  overallProjectCompletion: 30, // % of total project
  blockers: 0,
  behindSchedule: false,
  daysDeviation: 0,
  features: {
    socialFeed: 100,
    profiles: 95,
    reels: 85,
  }
}
```

### Report These in Weekly Summary

- **Velocity**: Tasks completed per week
- **Trending**: Behind/On Track/Ahead
- **Quality**: Any issues in delivered features
- **Risks**: Potential future delays
- **Morale**: Team confidence level
