## üí° FINAL NOTES

This is an ambitious, comprehensive analysis project. The goal is not just to improve a website, but to **transform IHEC's digital presence into a model of electoral transparency, civic engagement, and democratic participation for Iraq and the region**.

Success will be measured not in features launched, but in:
- **Increased voter registration and turnout**
- **More diverse and engaged candidates**
- **Greater public trust in elections**
- **Enhanced transparency and accountability**
- **Stronger civic culture year-round**

The agents should think beyond typical election commission websites and imagine what's possible when technology, design, and civic purpose align.

**Let's build the future of Iraqi democracy, one feature at a time.** üáÆüá∂
