**Steps:**
1. Read this README
2. Review `IHEC_ANALYSIS_AGENT_PROMPTS.md`
3. Deploy 5 AI agents (GPT-4, Claude, etc.) with their respective prompts
4. Follow timeline in `QUICK_START_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
5. Collect and synthesize reports after 2-3 weeks

**Pros:** Fast, comprehensive, cost-effective  
**Cons:** Requires validation by humans familiar with Iraqi context

---

### Option B: Human Research Team
**Best for:** Deep cultural understanding and stakeholder access

**Steps:**
1. Read all three main documents
2. Recruit 5 domain experts + 1 coordinator
3. Use agent prompts as research briefs
4. Follow implementation guide timeline
5. Produce reports and recommendations

**Pros:** Culturally nuanced, stakeholder buy-in, implementation-ready  
**Cons:** Time-intensive, expensive, requires expert availability

---

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Best Results)
**Best for:** Balancing speed, quality, and context

**Steps:**
1. Deploy AI agents for comprehensive research (Weeks 1-3)
2. Recruit 2-3 Iraqi/regional experts to review findings (Week 4)
3. Workshop with experts to adapt recommendations (Week 5)
4. Experts lead stakeholder engagement (Week 6+)
5. AI agents support ongoing iteration and documentation

**Pros:** Best of both worlds
