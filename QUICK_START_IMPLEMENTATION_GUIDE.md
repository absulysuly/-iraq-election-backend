**Remember:**
- Start with user needs (voters, candidates, IHEC staff)
- Build incrementally (Phase 1 quick wins â†’ advanced features)
- Test constantly (real users, real feedback)
- Stay flexible (politics and context may change)
- Measure impact (data-driven decision making)
- Think long-term (sustainable, Iraqi-owned platform)

**Most Importantly:**
Every feature you build, every improvement you make, contributes to strengthening democracy in Iraq. This work matters.
