### **Deployment Platform:**
Railway

### **Status:**
‚úÖ **LIVE** (confirmed - returns HTTP 200)

### **Possible Configuration:**
This might be a **unified frontend** that combines both the social media app and civic dashboards into one application. The name "hamlet-unified-complete-2027" suggests it's a merged/unified version.

---

## üîç WHERE ARE THE FRONTEND REPOSITORIES?

### **Option 1: Separate GitHub Repositories**
The frontends are likely in separate repositories under your GitHub account:

**Check these URLs:**
1. https://github.com/absulysuly/Copy-of-Hamlet-social
2. https://github.com/absulysuly/hamlat-forntend-6-10
3. https://github.com/absulysuly/hamlet-unified-complete-2027
4. https://github.com/absulysuly?tab=repositories (see all your repos)

### **Option 2: Different GitHub Organization**
The frontends might be under a different GitHub organization or team account.

### **Option 3: Branches in This Repository**
Let me check if there are frontend branches:

```bash
git branch -a | grep -i frontend
```

Result: Found branch `cursor/setup-and-coordinate-frontend-agent-build-02f4`

Let me check this branch for frontend code...

---

## üîé LET'S FIND THE FRONTEND!

### **Action Items:**

1. **Check the frontend branch:**
```bash
git checkout cursor/setup-and-coordinate-frontend-agent-build-02f4
ls -la
```

2. **Search your GitHub account:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/absulysuly?tab=repositories
   - Look for repos with "hamlet", "social", "civic", "frontend", or "election"

3. **Check Railway deployments:**
   - Go to: https://railway.com
   - Look at your projects
   - The frontend deployment should show the source repository

4. **Ask your team:**
   - If another team is working on the frontend, ask them for the repository URL

## üìä INTEGRATION STATUS

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Backend API is ready and tested locally
- Database schema is defined (18 governorates, users, posts, events, etc.)
- API contract is documented
- Backend ready for Railway deployment

### ‚è≥ What's Needed:
- Frontend repository links
- Frontend deployment status
- Backend-Frontend integration verification
- CORS configuration (ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable)

---

## üîß NEXT STEPS TO CONNECT EVERYTHING

### **Step 1: Locate Frontend Repositories**
Find the GitHub URLs for:
- [ ] Copy-of-Hamlet-social
- [ ] hamlat-forntend-6-10
- [ ] Or the unified frontend

### **Step 2: Deploy Backend**
Follow instructions in `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:
```bash
git push origin HEAD
# Then configure Railway with environment variables
```

### **Step 3: Connect Frontend to Backend**
Update frontend environment variables:
```env
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
# or
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app
```

### **Step 4: Configure CORS**
In backend Railway environment variables:
```env
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://hamlet-unified-complete-2027-production.up.railway.app
```

### **Step 5: Test Integration**
- Frontend calls backend API
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify data flows correctly

## ü§ù COLLABORATION WITH OTHER TEAM

You mentioned another team is working on a different branch. Here's how to coordinate:

### **Their Branch:**
`cursor/orchestrate-autonomous-multi-agent-development-workflow-2a3b`

### **Communication:**
- Check their commits: `git log origin/cursor/orchestrate-autonomous-multi-agent-development-workflow-2a3b`
- Review their changes: `git diff main..origin/cursor/orchestrate-autonomous-multi-agent-development-workflow-2a3b`
- Merge strategy: Coordinate before merging to avoid conflicts

## üí° FOR THE IHEC ANALYSIS PROJECT

All my recommendations in the IHEC analysis documents can be applied to:
1. **Backend:** Extend the existing `/civic/*` and `/social/*` endpoints
2. **Frontend #1 (Social):** Add women empowerment features, gamification, etc.
3. **Frontend #2 (Civic):** Add real-time dashboards, polling center maps, etc.

**The architecture is already set up perfectly for the IHEC enhancements!**

**Please share the frontend repository links so I can complete the analysis! üöÄ**
